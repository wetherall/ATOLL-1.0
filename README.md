_An atoll ( /ˈæt.ɒl, -ɔːl, -oʊl, əˈtɒl, -ˈtɔːl, -ˈtoʊl/), sometimes known as a coral atoll, is a ring-shaped coral reef, including a coral rim that encircles a lagoon partially or completely._

The result of a foolish PCB-first case-second approach to a hotswap 40% mechanical keyboard. 12.75u width with a split spacebar, HHKB bottom row, and an optional encoder in the top left. 

There's a hole in the middle. It serves no practical purpose.

Atoll is powered by [QMK](https://qmk.fm) firmware and comes with [Vial](https://get.vial.today) support already flashed.
